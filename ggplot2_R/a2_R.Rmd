## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


```{r}
if (!require("ggplot2")) {
  install.packages("ggplot2") # do this once per lifetime
  require("ggplot2") # do this once per session
}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}

library(ggplot2)
cars_sample <- read.csv('cars-sample.csv')
cars_sample

```


all the catagory

```{r}

catagories <- unique(cars_sample$Manufacturer)
catagories

```


```{r}
Weight = cars_sample$Weight
five_ways = ggplot(cars_sample, aes(x=Weight, y=MPG, color=Manufacturer, size=Weight))+geom_point(alpha=0.5)



five_ways + 
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "white", size = 1)) +
        scale_y_continuous(minor_breaks = seq(10, 50, 10))+
        scale_x_continuous(minor_breaks = seq(1000, 5000, 1000))+
        
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_line(colour = "white", size = 0.02)) +
        scale_y_continuous(minor_breaks = seq(10, 50, 5))+
        scale_x_continuous(minor_breaks = seq(1000, 5000, 500))
```


```{r}
cars_sample <- read.csv('cars-sample.csv')
cars_sample

```


```{r}
cars_sample <- read.csv('cars-sample.csv')
cars_sample

```{r}
