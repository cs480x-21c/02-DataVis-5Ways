#Get the data from the cars-sample csv file

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/Adria/OneDrive/Documents/R files")
cars <- read.csv("cars-sample.csv")
```

#Make the scatterplot, and be sure to decorate it :)

```{r}
ggplot(cars, aes(y=MPG, x=Weight, color=Manufacturer)) + geom_point(aes(size = Weight), alpha = 0.5)
```
