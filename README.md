# 02-DataVis-5ways - Completed by Alexander Bell

d3
---

Using d3 I worked on recreating the graph. Most things worked properly, however I could not get the text to show up in the SVG. I honestly have no idea why the code I wrote doesn't work. In the graph, everything else should be working properly, including the opacity being set to 50%. One thing that was difficult but solved was the issue of leading the csv file in, but Prof. Harrison's short video on how to do that put me in a much better place.

Excel
---

The biggest two difficulties with Excel I encountered, based on the data set, were separating the the manufacturers to change the color of the graph, and chaging the axes' labels to appear on the 10/20/30... and 2000/3000/4000... marks. I got around the first issue by sorting by manufacturer and simply creating 5 series on the same graph, so that I could select different properties for each. I only band-aided the issue of axis labels in the image by moving the axes themselves and taking a screenshot from the axes onward. The graph in the excel worksheet still looks as though it is counting from 0-46 in the case of MPG.

Tableau
---

Tableau was certainly the easiest to use once I got the hang of it. It's clear that this is a professional level visualization/graphing tool. I ran into no long term issues, the toughest thing for me to figure out was how to de-aggregate the data. THis tool certainly made a lot of things easy.

Other tools
---
I didn't have time to complete another 2 tools for this assignment. As it turns out, I'm really bad at time management.

Technical & Design Achievements
---
No technical/design acheivements. If I had extra time, I probably would have spent it on developing an extra tool.
