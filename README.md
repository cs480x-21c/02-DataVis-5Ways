# Vis 1: D3.js

D3 was fairly simple for me to use, however I was unable to get the background color and grid
of the graph as I was able to with some of the other tools I used. I definitely can see D3 being useful
in the future for visualizing graphs especially since the tool was built on that foundation.

# Vis 2: R + ggplot2

R is a popular language used for graphing and other visualization tools. To properly visualize the graph, I used the 'ggplot2'
library, which came with many series of functions that I needed to use to plot this graph. 
I used ggplot2's `geom_point()` layer, with aesthetics functions for the color and size. I don't think I will see myself be using R
in the future due to the difficulty of integrating it into other IDE's.

# Vis 3: Python + matplotlib

Python was also very simple for me to use due to Python's libraries, "pandas" and "matplotlib". These libraries came with a bunch of functions 
that I needed in order to plot the graph correctly in Python. I really liked using matplotlib because I didn't need many lines of code to 
do the scatter plot which I really enjoyed. I definitely see myself using Python in the future for projects.

# Vis 4: Tableau

I had never used Tableau before this, and found it to be the simplest of technologies. It was very user friendly and I was able to import my data
and make the visualization pretty quick. I was able to adjust the size, as well as the color and if the graph was trending upward or not. I would
definitely consider using Tableau when working with data.

# Vis 5: Excel

Ironically, I found Excel to be the hardest of technologies to use to make this graph. There is a steep learning curve when using Excel and I was not
prepared for the complications I ran into. I did not find Excel to be user friendly and there were things that I did not understand
very well about the software.
