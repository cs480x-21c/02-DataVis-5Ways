# Python + MatPlotLib

!MatPlotLib(img/MatPlotLibGraph.png)

<h5>Python is a general purpose programming lang. Mat Plot lib is a library I have had light experience with over the years.
    MatPlotLib outputs directly to a PNG. It was probably the 4th easiest tool to use</h5>

# Python + Plotly

!Plotly(img/PlotlyGraph.PNG)

<h5>Python is a general purpose programming lang. Plotly is a library I have had light experience with over the years.
    MatPlotLib outputs directly to a PNG. It was probably the 3rd easiest tool to use because of the use of dataframes to sort information rather than taking in different lists. </h5>

# Javascript + D3

!D3(img/D3graph.png)

<h5>Javascript is a general purpose programming lang. D3 is a library I enjoy but it kinda is a mess to make graphs with. I spent a lot of time searching through the tutorial pages in order to make it work but it was easy to put it on the site. It was the hardest tool to use</h5>

# Tableau

!Tableau(img/TableauGraph.PNG)

<h5>Tableau is a purpose build design software. I used a free trial and it was a dream to work with. I had never used it but its super easy and a ton of options. Easiest to use by far.</h5>

# Flourish

!Flourish(img/FlourishGraph.png)

<h5>Flourish is a purpose build design software. It is a free software. Again never used before but it was great. I highly recommend it but it isnt as good as Tableau which basically makes the graphs for you. Second easiest to use.</h5>

## Technical Achievements
For the technical achievement this week I had first attempted to provided the csv data through a s3 bucket via the django db.
This simply didnt get done unfortunately due to time constraints but I did get the DNS routing to work for my website
so the URL is more memorable for users of the site! I also added this courses work to my website for real so that employers
and others can see my achievements.

### Design Achievements
I redesigned my site's colorscheme and did my best to center all the graphs on the page. I also used CSS to try and scale them to similar sizes.
