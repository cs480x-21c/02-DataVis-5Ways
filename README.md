Assignment 2 - Data Visualization, 5 Ways  
===

Now that you have successfully made a "visualization" of shapes and lines using d3, your next assignment is to successfully make a *actual visualization*... 5 times. 

The goal of this project is to gain experience with as many data visualization libraries, languages, and tools as possible.

I have provided a small dataset about cars, `cars-sample.csv`.
Each row contains a car and several variables about it, including miles-per-gallon, manufacturer, and more.

Your goal is to use 5 different tools to make the following chart:

![ggplot2](img/ggplot2.png)

These features should be preserved as much as possible in your replication:

- Data positioning: it should be a downward-trending scatterplot as shown.  Weight should be on the x-axis and MPG on the y-axis.
- Scales: Note the scales do not start at 0.
- Axis ticks and labels: both axes are labeled and there are tick marks at 10, 20, 30, etcetera.
- Color mapping to Manufacturer.
- Size mapping to Weight.
- Opacity of circles set to 0.5 or 50%.

Other features are not required. This includes:

- The background grid.
- The legends.

Note that some software packages will make it **impossible** to perfectly preserve the above requirements. 
Be sure to note where these deviate.

Improvements are also welcome as part of Technical and Design achievements.
