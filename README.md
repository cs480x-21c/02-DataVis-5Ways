Assignment 2 - Data Visualization, 5 Ways  

For this assignment I chose to use excel, d3(javascript), matplotlib(python), tableau, and bubblechart(matlab).

# D3 - javascript

D3 is a library for programmatically creating html elements in javascript to create primarily data vizualizatations.

There we examples online of the scatter plot i wanted and was  fairly simple to recreate especially with d3 csv reading.

Creating the axis labels was difficult to have the correct alignment.

# Excel
Excel is a common desktop application used for managing and displaying data. It was especially difficult since there was no coding involved and I had to give the graph  all of the data by manufacturer manaully because excel parses your intent.

# Matplotlib - python

Python is a popular programming data that is used for all sorts of general programming and data science.

I was already familiar with matplotlib, numpy, and pandas so I was able to parse the csv really quickly and go straight to plotting. 

The colors where strings so it was fairly limited in terms of colors.

# Tableau

Tableau is a too I never used before and was extremlely easy to use. The program seems to be very focused on creating vizualizations from data. It should be commended on its ease of use. The liscence was free since i was a student.

I struggled seperating the sized of the bubbles to the example.

# Bubblechart - MatLab

Matlab is a popular langauge for vectore base mathematics. It is often used by engineers. 

I used my roomates computer since it had the latest version already installed and had him help me with syntax and basic language features, since I had very little previous Matlab expereince

## Technical Achievements
- **Different Libraries**: Did not use any same language libraries to explore a variety of tools.
