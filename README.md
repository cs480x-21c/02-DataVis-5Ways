Assignment 2 - Data Visualization, 5 Ways

#R+ggplot2
R is a language and environment especially for statistical computing
 and graphics (cited from R official website). It is a very powerful
 tool to analyze data and create visualization to present data. This 
 is my first time to try R, and how concise and convenient it is
 surprised me. The core part to draw the scatter plot is actually
 a piece of one-line code. Combined with R, I used ggplot2 package
 which is a data visualization package in R. I first retrieved the
 data from sample csv file by using read.csv() function and then 
 used ggplot() function to draw the points on the graph and assigning
 different colors and sizes based on the Manufacturer and Weight, 
 respectively. With R and ggplot2, the legend is also quite easy
 to draw.
