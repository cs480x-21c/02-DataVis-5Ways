## Visualization for Assingment 2 in CS480X
### By Lucas Fernandes

My first R project and visualization

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data <- ggplot(carsSample, aes(x=Weight, y=MPG, color=Manufacturer, size=Weight), na.rm=TRUE)+geom_point(alpha=.5)
suppressWarnings(print(data))
```
